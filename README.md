# Ping-Pong-Game
"The Classic Ping Pong" is a two-player retro-style game developed using Python with the Turtle graphics library. This project replicates the classic ping pong game where two players compete to score points by hitting a ball with their paddles. The game features simple yet effective graphics, responsive controls, and sound effects that simulate the bounce of the ball. The first player to miss the ball loses a point, and the game continues until a player reaches a predetermined score.
This project showcases the use of Python's Turtle and Winsound libraries to create a visually appealing and interactive game. It demonstrates skills in graphics programming, sound integration, and real-time game mechanics, making it an excellent example of a beginner-level game development project in Python.
